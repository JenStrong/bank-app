# Bank Tech Test

## Overview
This is a CLI Ruby app that generates a bank account summary table based on the deposits and withdrawls a user makes to their account. This project is a sample tech test used to demonstrate my ability to:
  1. Write code others can easily understand
  2. Build with objects
  3. Test-drive my code

## Getting Started
